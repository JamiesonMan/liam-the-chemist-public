This repository is meant for me to show this cool project I spent so much time on, without opening some attack vector or worrying about a secret getting out.

Watch the demo video to see the functionality I implemented for his website.
The beauty in this website is that he can post his Desmos math projects as interactables embeded on the website.
His projects however are similar to handling complexities you'd expect in MatLab, simulating physics phenomena and even a neural network approximating a function.
So I leave him with the keys to publishing his desmos and chemistry projects and a great interactive enviornment for other people to mess with them.
