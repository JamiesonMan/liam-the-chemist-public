# liam-the-chemist-public
A collection of liamthechemist.com redacting anything leading to cyber security concerns.

This repository is meant for me to show this cool project I spent so much time on, without opening some attack vector or worrying about a secret getting out.

So it is instead a collection of screenshots safely showing the interface, and a perspective of the admin control panel I designed. This website allows my brother to dynamically control his projects and his cool math stuff!
The beauty in this website is that he can post his Desmos math projects as interactables embeded on the website.
His projects however are similar to handling complexities you'd expect in MatLab, simulating physics phenomena and even a neural network approximating a function.
So I leave him with the keys to publishing his desmos and chemistry projects and a great interactive enviornment for other people to mess with them.

I use the server also to host some of my own web based projects, such as the bird cam project.
